####When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want other people to be able to contribute.
When I want to have a synced central hub for my data.

####Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The remote repository may not necessarily have changes that I want in my local repository
