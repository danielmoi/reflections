####When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want other people to be able to contribute.
When I want to have a synced central hub for my data.

####Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The remote repository may not necessarily have changes that I want in my local repository

####Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Clones are simply copies.  
Forks are clones of a remote – to another remote.  
Branches are within a repo – and can exist in forks and clones  

####What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
I think this is to allow comparison between the local and remote repos (via the locally stored copy of the remote).
