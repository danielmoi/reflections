####1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want other people to be able to contribute.
When I want to have a synced central hub for my data.

####2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The remote repository may not necessarily have changes that I want in my local repository

####3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Clones are simply copies.  
Forks are clones of a remote – to another remote.  
Branches are within a repo – and can exist in forks and clones  

####4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
I think this is to allow comparison between the local and remote repos (via the locally stored copy of the remote).  

####5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
It would require emailing versions / working off the same server?  
It would be more difficult because I would lose tools like comparison between versions.  
But it would be easier with respect to not needing to setup and learn git and GitHub.

####6. When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
It allows more flexibility – changes can be made without the "live" version being broken.  
Changes can be reviewed at the author's leisure, and incorporated so that the master branch always "works".
